## [Understand Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM)](https://deeplearning4j.org/lstm.html)
I learnt directly from [these sites] so I posted their links.
1. Learn the model LSTM from [this blog](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/)
2. Understand how it can be applied to time-series prediction from [this blog](https://machinelearningmastery.com/time-series-prediction-lstm-recurrent-neural-networks-python-keras/)

This repository is used to document the process and result in the Directed Field Work 2017 when working for Ayo AI. 
All the reports and documentations in this repository will relate to the learning outcomes described in the DWF Learning Outcomes
