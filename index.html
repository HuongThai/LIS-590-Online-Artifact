  <p>General Overview</p>
<p>My directed fieldwork is with the Ayo AI, a start-up in Kirkland, who’s working hard to
  develop machine learning models in different applications.</p>
<p>Learning the opportunity to develop a forecasting model using Neural Networks on time
series data, I joined the team to develop a model in Python, using Keras. Kenneth is my host
  supervisor.</p>
<p>Most of what I am doing is applying machine learning to build a neural-network based time
series model that performs better than the previous baseline, which used vector
  autoregression.</p>
<p>The Ayo AI is a newly founded start-up with an ambitious mission in applying the newest
innovation in data science field. It's a challenging but exciting experience working and
  being supported by smartest coworkers.</p>
<p>This repository is used to collect all the weekly submissions in the Directed Field Work 2017 project when working for Ayo AI.
The artifacts in this repository will relate to the learning outcomes described in the DWF Learning Outcomes as below </p>
