My directed fieldwork is with the Ayo AI, a start-up in Kirkland, who’s working hard to
develop machine learning models in different applications.
Learning the opportunity to develop a forecasting model using Neural Networks on time
series data, I joined the team to develop a model in Python, using Keras. Kenneth is my host
supervisor.
Most of what I am doing is applying machine learning to build a neural-network based time
series model that performs better than the previous baseline, which used vector
autoregression.
The Ayo AI is a newly founded start-up with an ambitious mission in applying the newest
innovation in data science field. It's a challenging but exciting experience working and
being supported by smartest coworkers.
